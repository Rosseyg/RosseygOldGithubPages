# Simple web app deployment for simple programs

## Highlights

- Intermediate level
- Python language
- Github version control
- Pythonanywhere execution environment
- Django and Django ORM with sqlite

### Overall

1. Initialize private Github repo and invite collaborators
2. Create /scripts folder for automated programs
3. Create Django project to utilize Django ORM to interact with database
4. Pull repo into Pythonanywhere and configure tasks to run

This approach is idea for small projects with junior to mid-level python developers yet can scale if needed.  The free tiers on Github and Pythonanywhere offer version control and one daily task respectively, enough to get started at no up-front cost.  Using the Django web framework can be used internally to store and process data and can be scaled to a full featured web app if needed

## Code samples
### Create and use virtual environment on mac
```
python3.X -m venv myVenv
source myVenv/bin/activate
```
