<p>Willoughby is a friendly and playful Blue Blood Bulldog. She has a beautiful Fawn Merle coat and a aggressively loving temperament.  Willy is a dog who loves to explore and have fun. She is wild and fast, and she does not listen well to commands. She abounds with furious curiosity, and she wants to see and smell everything around her. She often gets into trouble, but she always has a big smile on her face.</p>
