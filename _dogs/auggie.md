{{ page.name }} is a big-faced face licker.  Auggie's legs are forever injured from many recommended Roy's sugeries.  {{ page.knickname }} loves his owner and his home. He is aggressive towards strangers and people he knows, because he wants to defend his territory and his family. He does not trust anyone who comes near his house, and he barks at intruders to scare them away. He likes treats, though, and he might warm up to someone who offers him a tasty snack.

Auggie has injured legs because of many preemptive surgeries. He had these surgeries to prevent future problems with his joints and bones. He presently suffers from pain and stiffness in his legs, which makes it hard for him to walk and run. He spends a lot of his time on the couch, where he can rest and relax. He enjoys cuddling with his owners and pets.
